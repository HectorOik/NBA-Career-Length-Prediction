# NBA Career Length Prediction

In this project I use machine learning techniques on datasets on the NBA (National Basketball Association) taken from kaggle to attempt and predict the career length of an NBA Player based on their
stats in the rookie season.

Step by step instructions on how the data was preprocessed and what models were used for the prediction are found in the nba-career-length-prediction-regression jupyter notebook.

Please let me know if I have made any oversights in my data preprocessing, data analysis and model fitting. All criticism is welcome.
